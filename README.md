## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd project-athena
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure AI Guide (Optional):
To enable the full AI-powered Socratic Guide, get a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio and update the server environment:
```bash
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here" >> server/.env
```

4. Start the development servers:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- Backend server on `http://localhost:5000`
- Frontend development server on `http://localhost:3000`

**Note**: The AI Guide works in fallback mode without an API key, providing basic Socratic questioning.

## Product Vision

Project Athena aims to be the "calm, wise guide" that helps users transform overwhelming tasks into clear, actionable plans. By combining effective task management with intelligent AI guidance, we empower users to overcome executive function challenges and achieve their goals with confidence.

The name "Athena" reflects our commitment to wisdom, strategy, and thoughtful guidance rather than quick fixes or automated solutions. Our AI doesn't do the work for you â€“ it helps you discover the path forward through Socratic questioning and gentle guidance.
