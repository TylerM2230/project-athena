## Product Requirements Document: Project Athena

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** August 24, 2025
**Author:** Product Management
**Status:** Draft

### 1. Introduction and Purpose

Project Athena is a personal productivity and knowledge management application designed to assist individuals with executive and demand functioning. Its core mission is to help users who feel overwhelmed by large, complex tasks. Athena achieves this by providing a structured system for decomposing these tasks into manageable sub-goals. This document outlines the requirements for Version 1.0, which includes a core feature: an **AI-powered Socratic Guide** using a Gemini API to facilitate task decomposition through interactive dialogue.

### 2. The Problem

Many individuals, particularly those with executive function challenges (e.g., ADHD) or those in high-demand roles, struggle with initiating and completing large or vaguely defined tasks (e.g., "write thesis," "plan project launch," "find a new job"). This leads to procrastination, anxiety, and reduced productivity. Existing task managers help organize work but often fail to address the crucial first step: breaking the overwhelming task into something actionable.

### 3. Goals and Objectives

| Goal                                      | Description                                                                        | Key Metrics                                                                                                                                                                            |

### 4. Target Audience & User Personas

1.  **Alex the Overwhelmed Professional:** A 35-year-old project manager. Alex juggles multiple complex projects with ambiguous requirements. They need a tool to bring clarity and structure to their work, identify hidden dependencies, and keep a log of decisions and learnings.
2.  **Sam the Neurodivergent Student:** A 22-year-old university student with ADHD. Sam struggles with executive functions like planning, prioritization, and task initiation for large academic assignments. They need a non-judgmental, guided system to help them start their work and build momentum.

### 5. Features and Functionality

#### 5.1. Core Module: Task Management

A robust system for capturing, organizing, and tracking tasks.

- **5.1.1. Task Inbox:** Quick-capture interface for adding tasks without friction.
- **5.1.2. Task Properties:** Each task can have a title, description, due date, priority level, and status (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Done).
- **5.1.3. Hierarchical Tasks:** Ability to view parent tasks and their sub-tasks in an outline or nested list. Sub-tasks generated by the AI Guide will appear here.
- **5.1.4. Project Views:** Users can visualize tasks in different formats (List, Kanban Board, Calendar).

#### 5.2. Core Module: Knowledge Management System (KMS)

A personal wiki for building a "second brain."

- **5.2.1. Note Editor:** A clean, markdown-supported editor for creating notes.
- **5.2.2. Bi-Directional Linking:** Users can link notes to other notes (`[[note title]]`) and link tasks directly to relevant notes to provide context.

#### 5.3. **Keystone Feature: The AI-Powered Socratic Guide**

This feature integrates a Gemini API to create an interactive, conversational experience for task decomposition.

- **5.3.1. Invocation:** On any task, the user can select an option like "Decompose with AI Guide."
- **5.3.2. Conversational Interface:** The feature opens a chat-like interface. The AI's persona is a calm, inquisitive, and supportive guide.
- **5.3.3. Context-Aware Questioning:** The AI initiates a dialogue based on the task's title and description. It asks a series of Socratic questions designed to:
  - **Clarify the Goal:** "What does the finished version of this task look like to you?"
  - **Challenge Assumptions:** "What resources are you assuming you'll have for this?"
  - **Explore Steps:** "What is the very first physical action someone would need to take?"
  - **Identify Roadblocks:** "What part of this feels the most difficult or uncertain to you right now?"
  - **Examine Alternatives:** "If you only had half the time, what would be the most essential parts to complete?"
- **5.3.4. Interactive Dialogue:** The user's answers are used as context for the AI's subsequent questions, creating a tailored and dynamic conversation.
- **5.3.5. Plan Generation:** At any point, the user can ask the AI to "Generate a plan based on our conversation." The AI will summarize the dialogue and output a structured list of recommended sub-tasks.
- **5.3.6. User-in-Control Editing:** The generated plan is fully editable. The user can review, add, remove, or rephrase sub-tasks before importing them into the Task Management module.

### 6. Gemini API Integration Details

- **6.1. API Selection:** The application will use the Google AI API to call a suitable Gemini model. **Gemini 1.5 Flash** is the preferred model due to its large context window, speed, and cost-effectiveness, which are ideal for a real-time conversational interface.
- **6.2. Prompt Engineering:**
  - A carefully crafted **system prompt** will define the AI's persona and behavior. It will instruct the AI to act as a Socratic guide, to be encouraging, to avoid giving direct solutions unless asked, and to focus on breaking down problems. (See Appendix A for an example).
  - Each user message will be appended to a conversation history to maintain context throughout the dialogue.
- **6.3. Data Flow:**
  1.  User invokes the AI Guide on a task (e.g., "Plan European Vacation").
  2.  The app sends the initial system prompt, the task title/description, and the first user prompt to the Gemini API.
  3.  The API returns the first Socratic question.
  4.  The user's answer is sent back to the API along with the conversation history.
  5.  This loop continues until the user requests a plan.
- **6.4. Privacy and Security:**
  - API calls will only send data related to the _specific task_ being decomposed. No other personal data or notes from the KMS will be sent unless the user explicitly links a note to the task for context.
  - The use of the AI feature will be opt-in per task.
  - All communication with the API will be over HTTPS.
- **6.5. Error Handling:** The application must gracefully handle API errors (e.g., network issues, API downtime). A fallback to pre-defined, static Socratic templates will be offered if the AI Guide is unavailable.

### 7. Design and UX Considerations

- **Calm and Focused UI:** The interface should be minimalist and free of clutter to avoid contributing to user overwhelm.
- **Conversational Feel:** The AI interaction should be presented in a familiar chat bubble format.
- **Transparency:** Clearly indicate when the user is interacting with an AI. Provide visual feedback (e.g., typing indicators) while waiting for an API response.
- **Onboarding:** A brief, optional tutorial should explain how the AI Guide works and how to get the most out of it.

### 8. Technical Requirements

- **Platform:** Cross-platform Desktop (Windows, macOS via Electron) and Mobile (iOS, Android via React Native).
- **Data Storage:** Local-first database (e.g., SQLite) to ensure the app is functional offline.
- **Cloud Sync:** Optional, end-to-end encrypted cloud synchronization for users who want to use the app across multiple devices.
- **Backend:** A lightweight backend will be required to manage API keys securely and potentially handle user subscriptions.

### 9. Assumptions and Constraints

- Users will need an active internet connection to use the AI-Powered Socratic Guide.
- The cost of Gemini API calls will be a significant operational expense that needs to be factored into the business model (e.g., via a premium subscription).
- The quality of the AI-generated plan is dependent on the quality of the user's input and the effectiveness of our prompt engineering.

### 10. Release 1.0 Criteria & Future Scope

**Release 1.0 must include:**

- Functional Task Management and Knowledge Management System with linking.
- Full integration of the Gemini API for the AI-Powered Socratic Guide.
- Stable performance on all target platforms.

**Future Scope (Post-1.0):**

- **AI-Powered Knowledge Synthesis:** Allow the AI to read linked notes to provide even more context-rich questions and suggestions.
- **AI-Powered Roadblock Analysis:** The AI could proactively identify potential roadblocks in a generated plan and suggest preemptive solutions.
- **AI-Powered Weekly Review:** An AI assistant that helps the user review their completed tasks, reflect on challenges, and plan the week ahead.

### Appendix A: Example System Prompt for Gemini API

```
You are Athena, a calm, patient, and insightful Socratic guide. Your purpose is to help users who feel overwhelmed break down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps.

Your rules are:
1.  **Never give the full solution.** Your role is to ask guiding questions, not to do the work.
2.  **Always ask one open-ended question at a time.** Avoid asking multiple questions in a single response.
3.  **Keep your tone encouraging and non-judgmental.** Use phrases like "That's a great starting point," or "Let's explore that a bit more."
4.  **Base your next question on the user's previous answer.** Make the conversation feel natural and adaptive.
5.  **Focus on clarifying goals, identifying first steps, challenging assumptions, and uncovering potential obstacles.**
6.  If the user seems stuck, suggest a different angle (e.g., "What if we thought about this from the end and worked backwards?").
7.  **Only when the user explicitly asks for a plan** (e.g., "can you make a plan for me," "summarize this into steps"), should you provide a clear, actionable list of sub-tasks based on the entire conversation. Format this plan using markdown with headings and bullet points.
