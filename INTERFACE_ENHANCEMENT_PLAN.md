- Quick task entry with minimal friction (inline form)
- Context-aware task recommendations (smart sorting)
- Better task prioritization through visual cues
- Reduced mental overhead in understanding task structure

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 weeks) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN estimated_minutes INTEGER DEFAULT NULL;
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN energy_level VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'medium';
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN context_tags TEXT DEFAULT NULL;
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN template_id VARCHAR(36) DEFAULT NULL;

-- Conversation persistence
CREATE TABLE ai_conversations (
  id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
  task_id VARCHAR(36) REFERENCES tasks(id),
  messages TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Task templates
CREATE TABLE task_templates (
  id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  template_data TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Component Architecture

- Implement task-specific components in `client/src/components/tasks/`
- Add visualization components in `client/src/components/visualization/`
- Create AI-related components in `client/src/components/ai/`

### API Endpoints to Add
```
GET/POST /api/templates - Task template management
GET/POST /api/ai-conversations - Conversation persistence  
POST /api/tasks/analyze - AI task analysis
POST /api/recommendations - Smart task recommendations
POST /api/tasks/batch-create - Bulk task creation from templates
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### User Experience Principles
1. **Reduce Cognitive Load**: Present information in digestible chunks
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Use size, color, and spacing to guide attention
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show details only when needed
4. **Immediate Feedback**: Provide clear responses to user actions
5. **Error Prevention**: Design to minimize mistakes and confusion

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow existing TypeScript patterns and interfaces
- Maintain consistent component structure
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Include accessibility attributes from the start
- Write unit tests for complex logic
- Document component props and usage

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load visualization libraries (D3.js)
- Implement virtual scrolling for large task lists
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Debounce search and filter operations
- Cache API responses where appropriate

This implementation plan focuses on progressive enhancement, starting with simple UX improvements and building toward more sophisticated features that specifically address ADHD and executive function challenges through better visual design, reduced cognitive load, and intelligent assistance.
